# App stores
AntennaPod is only officially published in 2 stores. Unfortunately, we don't have the time to support any other store than Google Play and F-Droid. All other stores listing AntennaPod copied the app without our explicit permission. We are not responsible for updating those or making sure they work correctly.

## Google Play
You can find the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod).

## F-Droid
You can find the app [here](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.danoeh.antennapod).

The F-Droid repository is not maintained by us, but by the people behind F-Droid. If it is not the latest version, there's not so much we can do but you can always let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/), and we'll investigate it.

# About AntennaPod
AntennaPod is not developed by an organisation, but by volunteers throughout the world. Our support is provided by volunteers, too. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org)! We are happy to help. If you want to help others, you can reply to [unanswered questions](https://forum.antennapod.org/search?q=status%3Anoreplies%20after%3A2020-06-15%20order%3Alatest), [contribute code](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues) or [translate the app](https://www.transifex.com/antennapod/antennapod/).
